# ✈️ Azure Lakehouse — FAA Flight Analytics

## Project Overview

This project implements an **end-to-end Azure Lakehouse architecture** using **publicly available U.S. FAA / BTS flight performance data** to demonstrate **production-grade data engineering practices**.

The objective is to design and implement a scalable data platform that supports **analytics, BI, and AI workloads**, following modern **ETL and ELT patterns** and the **Medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)**.

This project is part of the broader **Data Engineering portfolio** and is designed as a realistic, enterprise-style case study rather than a tutorial.

## Business Context

Aviation analytics is a data-intensive domain involving large volumes of time-series and event-based data.  
Airlines, regulators, and analysts rely on this data to understand:

- Flight delays and cancellations  
- Operational performance trends  
- Airport and carrier efficiency  
- Seasonal and systemic disruption patterns  

This project focuses on **historical, aggregated flight performance analytics**, not real-time or safety-critical operations.

---

## Data Source

This project uses **publicly available flight performance data** published by U.S. aviation authorities.

**Key characteristics:**
- Domain: Commercial aviation analytics
- Data type: Historical batch files (CSV / Parquet)
- Update frequency: Periodic (monthly)
- Usage: Educational and analytical purposes only

No restricted, real-time, sensitive, or personally identifiable data is used.

## Architecture Overview

The solution follows a **Lakehouse-first design**, combining scalable storage, distributed processing, and analytical SQL engines.

## ETL and ELT Strategy

This project intentionally applies **both ETL and ELT patterns**, based on layer responsibility.

### ETL (Ingestion & Curation)
Used to ensure data correctness and quality before analytics consumption.

- Raw ingestion into Bronze (append-only)
- Data cleansing and standardization in Silver
- Incremental and idempotent processing
- Data quality validation

**Technologies:** Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks (PySpark, Delta Lake)

---

### ELT (Analytics & Serving)
Used to apply business logic and analytics transformations inside SQL engines.

- Fact and Dimension table creation
- SCD Type 1 and Type 2 logic
- Metric calculations and aggregations
- Star schema modeling

**Technologies:** Azure Synapse Analytics, SQL
