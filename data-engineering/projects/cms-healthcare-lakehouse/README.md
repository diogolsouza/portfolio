# 🏥 Azure Lakehouse - CMS Healthcare Analytics

## Project Overview

This project implements an **end-to-end Azure Lakehouse architecture** using **publicly available U.S. Medicare data** published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to demonstrate **production-grade data engineering practices**.

The objective is to design and implement a scalable healthcare data platform that supports **analytics, BI, and AI workloads**, following modern **ETL and ELT patterns** and the **Medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)**.

This project is part of a broader **Data Engineering portfolio** and is intentionally designed as a **realistic, enterprise-style case study**, not a tutorial.

## Business Context

Healthcare analytics is a highly regulated, data-intensive domain involving large volumes of financial, operational, and quality-related data.  
Public and private stakeholders rely on this data to understand:

- Medicare cost and utilization patterns  
- Provider and hospital performance  
- Regional disparities in healthcare spending  
- Relationships between cost and quality of care  

This project focuses on **historical, aggregated healthcare analytics**, not real-time clinical decision-making.

---

## Data Source

This project uses **publicly available Medicare datasets** published by the **U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)**.

**Key characteristics:**
- Domain: Healthcare cost, utilization, and quality analytics
- Data type: Historical batch files (CSV)
- Update frequency: Periodic (annual / quarterly, depending on dataset)
- Usage: Educational and analytical purposes only

No protected health information (PHI), personally identifiable data, or restricted datasets are used.

---

## Architecture Overview

The solution follows a **Lakehouse-first design**, combining scalable cloud storage, distributed processing, and analytical SQL engines.

## ETL and ELT Strategy

This project intentionally applies **both ETL and ELT patterns**, based on data layer responsibility.

### ETL (Ingestion & Curation)

ETL is used to ensure **data correctness, standardization, and quality** before analytics consumption.

- Raw ingestion into Bronze (append-only)
- Data cleansing and conformance in Silver
- Incremental and idempotent processing
- Healthcare-specific data quality validation (keys, ranges, null checks)

**Technologies:** Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks (PySpark, Delta Lake)

---

### ELT (Analytics & Serving)

ELT is used to apply **business logic and analytics transformations** inside SQL-based analytical engines.

- Fact and Dimension table creation
- SCD Type 1 and Type 2 logic
- Metric calculations and aggregations
- Star schema modeling for BI and analytics

**Technologies:** Azure Synapse Analytics, SQL
