# 📊 Power BI - Superstore = Executive Business Intelligence Dashboard

The project is designed as a **portfolio-grade BI solution**, combining:
- Executive-level storytelling
- Strong analytical modeling
- Well-structured DAX measures
- Clear documentation for reproducibility and review

Because the Power BI tenant may expire, the dashboard is documented using **PDF exports and high-resolution screenshots** instead of live links.
